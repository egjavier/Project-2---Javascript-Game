Memory Card Game with 6 Lives - Description and Rules

Game Objective:
The objective of the memory card game is to match pairs of cards with the same images or symbols while preserving your 6 lives. The game is won when all card pairs have been successfully matched, or it can end in a loss if you run out of lives.

#Components:
Game Board: 
  The game board is a grid of facedown cards, typically arranged in rows and columns.

Cards: 
  Each card has an image on one side (the front) and a playing card side (the back). There are always two identical cards with the same image or symbol.

Lives: 
  The player starts with 6 lives, which represent the number of chances they have to make incorrect matches.

#Rules:

Setup:
  The game board is populated with a set of cards randomly arranged face down.
  Each card has a matching pair on the board.
  
 Gameplay:
  The player starts by selecting two facedown cards. Clicking on a card flips it to reveal the image or symbol.
  If the two cards match, they remain face up, and the player proceeds to the next turn.
  If the two cards do not match, they are flipped back face down, and the player loses one life.
  The player continues to take turns until all pairs of cards are successfully matched or until they run out of lives.

Winning:
  The game is won when all card pairs have been successfully matched and are face up on the board.
  The player's victory is celebrated with a winning message.
  Losing:
  
  The game can end in a loss if the player runs out of lives before matching all the pairs.
  When the player loses a life, it is displayed on the screen to keep them informed of their remaining lives.
  If the player loses all 6 lives, the game is over, and a "Game Over" message is displayed.
  
Restart:
  After winning or losing, the game wil automatically restart.
